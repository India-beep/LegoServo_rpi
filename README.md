# LegoServo_rpi
## Overview of project
Repository for 9 V Lego servo motor control with a Raspberry Pi.
## Project components
This project will utilise a Rasbperry Pi 4 B as the controller, the [Adafruit DC/Stepper Motor HAT](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi), and a [9 V Lego servo motor](https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-medium-stone-gray-medium-power-functions-motor-16512-58120). The purpose of the HAT is to prevent the Raspberry Pi having issues because the motor functions at 9 V but Raspberry Pis operate at 5 V, the HAT mediates this because it can handle much greater voltages and will only output 5 V to the Raspberry Pi.
